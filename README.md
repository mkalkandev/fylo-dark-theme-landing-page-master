This was my sixth project with HTML and CSS and I am happy with the result. This time I tried to learn new things, so I tried to structure HTML better and used flex and grid in CSS. It was the most difficult application for me so far. I am lacking in the background part.

I plan to continue exploring this technology and learning more, so there will definitely be more projects related to it soon.
